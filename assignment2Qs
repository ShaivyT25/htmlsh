1. em vs rem

An em is equal to the computed font-size of that element's parent. If the font-size is not defined explicitly, that element will inherit
from its parent. ems work great with layouts.

rem values are relative to the root html element, not to the parent element. When it comes to spacing and font-sizing, using rem is preferable.

2. CSS Selectors

• .class - This selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. 
• #id - This selector styles the element with the specified id.

• div ~ p - General sibling selector. The ~ combinator separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it is preceded by the first 
            element, and both share a common parent. 
• div, p - element, element : Selects all the <div> and all the <p> elements.
• div > p - element > element : Selects all <p> elements where parent is a <div> element. 
• div + p - Adjacent sibling selector (E1 + E2). The selector matches if E1 and E2 share the same parent in the document tree and E1 immediately
            precedes E2, ignoring non-element nodes (such as text nodes and comments).
            ul + p {
                color: red;
            }
            In this example, only the first paragraph after each <ul> will have red text.

• [target] - Selects all the elements with a target attribute.
             <style>
                a[target] {
                 background-color: yellow;
                }
             </style>
