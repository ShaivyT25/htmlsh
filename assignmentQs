1. What is non-breaking in &nbsp? 

A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line. 
Two words seperated by a non-breaking will stick together(not break into a new line). 

2. What is encoding?

Words and sentences in text are created from characters. You may not be able to see some of the characters in this page because you don't have the necessary fonts. If you click on the place where you expected to see a character you will link to a graphic version. 
Characters that are needed for a specific purpose are grouped into a character set (also called a repertoire).The characters are stored in the computer as one or more bytes.

Basically, you can visualise this by assuming that all characters are stored in computers using a special code, like the ciphers used in espionage. A character encoding provides a key to unlock (ie. crack) the code. 
It is a set of mappings between the bytes in the computer and the characters in the character set.

So, when you input text using a keyboard or in some other way, the character encoding maps characters you choose to specific bytes in computer memory, 
and then to display the text it reads the bytes back into characters. There are many different character sets and character encodings.

3. Difference between .txt, .docx, .html

.txt - They have a ‘.txt’ file extension. They store plain text. They’re lightning fast to open, save, and store.
You can open them with any text editing software, on any computer. 

.docx - They have a ‘.docx’ file extension. Microsoft began developing them in the 1980s. And back then, they had a ‘.doc’ extension.
They have every conceivable editing feature you’ll need. You can format and align your text, like with RTFs. 
But you can also insert complex images, tables, charts, headers/footers, hyperlinks, comments, references, watermarks, macros, and a host of other things. 
As well as check spellings, grammar, and track changes made to documents. They require Microsoft Word software to be opened.

.html - This stands for Hyper Text Markup Language file extension. Defines the structure and layout of a web document.

4. id vs name

The ID of a form input element has nothing to do with the data contained within the element. IDs are for hooking the element with JavaScript and CSS. 
The name attribute, however, is used in the HTTP request sent by your browser to the server as a variable name associated with the data contained in the value attribute.

5. Apply color to a textarea by using color input tag

<div>
    <input type="color" id="color-txa" name="color-txa" value="#FF8733">
    <label for="color-txa">Select Color</label>
    <br>
    <br>
    <textarea rows="5" cols="20" id="txa"></textarea>
</div>

<script>
    var colorTa = document.getElementById("color-txa");
    colorTa.addEventListener('change', () => {
        document.getElementById("txa").style.backgroundColor = colorTa.value;
    });
</script>
